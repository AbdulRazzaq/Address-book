These diagrams are just the intial ones, you can have some suggestions on them
and talk with us to refine them.

Hey! please leave your comments and to make the diagrams more compact and complete, if they are already fine please think about functions 
that are presented in sequence and activity diagrams. 
This will helpe us to be more consistant from our modeling to implementations.
