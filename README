These diagrams are just the intial ones, you can have some suggestions on them
and talk with us to refine them.

Hey! please leave your comments and to make the diagrams more compact and complete, if they are already fine please
think about functions that are presented in sequence and activity diagrams. 
This will helpe us to be more consistant from our modeling to implementations. 

Documentation guys! please refelect it to wiki.



I added all diagrams in one folder.
Documentation group should use it to update the group wiki.
For others your welcome for some nice suggestions this time hopefully.
